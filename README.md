This repository contains the sources to build the docker image pschuller/arduino-base.

This image is inspired by https://github.com/zoobab/arduino-cli-esp8266 resp. https://hub.docker.com/r/zoobab/arduino-cli. Opposing to this image it uses the latest stable release of arduino-cli instead of compiling it from the sources.
